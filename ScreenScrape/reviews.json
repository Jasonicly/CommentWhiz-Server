      "body": "I have dark, thick Asian hair. Love this product, it’s quite gentle and so easy to apply. Does burn your skin so be sure to wipe off the foam from your neck and face, don’t let it sit. That being said, as a gentle foam bleach it won’t make Asian hair blonde after one application. You need several. And it does make your hair the same as the box. Same color and tone, so sort of peachy and orangey. You can make it lighter than the box with more applications though. In the end it’s not quite cheap, but cheaper than going to the salon, and if you’re doing it yourself, foam is WAY easier. The foil and paint on method is sooo hard to do on yourself. Ive attempted it before and it took forever,and I had to use so many mirrors. Results are stronger (lighter) on first round of bleaching but margin of error is bigger. The foam is so easy to end up with an even application. I add in 2.3 ml of olaplex no 1 to each bottle I use, rinse after 30 mins, and do a hair mask with olaplex no 2 for 15 mins. After that I again rinse out. I do that for each application of this bleach, and my hair has turned out really healthy looking and not fried! Also Olaplex 03 (bond maker) hair mask 2x a week. I’ve used olaplex with the usual powder + developer bleaches and my hair didn’t turn out as soft and healthy looking as with this foam bleach!",

      "body": "Was debating to use this primer or the EzN bleach, chose to go with this one because it’s supposed to be a mild bleach. Only about 2 inches of my roots were virgin black hair, the rest was previously dyed dark brown with Liese box dye. The application was easy, I sectioned my hair out and was able to get it evenly bleached very easily. My hair is a short bob so one bottle was plenty. I took about 5-10 mins to apply, then waited 25 mins before rinse off. I also wore a plastic bag with sprayed mist to enhance the bleach (bleach could dry out easily and needs to be moist to work). The result is very mild…can’t really tell under artificial light, but it looks like a natural dark brown in natural light. My hair was really healthy before this primer, it still looks healthy and shiny after, but I could tell i my hair is a little dryer after the primer. For that reason I don’t plan on using the primer again immediately although I still want to bleach it again. I never intended to use this to get to a really light color, but a medium brown would be ideal. Seems like I will need to bleach multiple times to get to medium brown though.",

It's very mild.\n\nThat being said, there was very little change to my hair color. I had medium brown hair with about an inch of virgin black and it only lifted a slight bit. The medium brown didn't really change. I usually use L'Oreal Superior Preference in Hi-Lift natural brown for my roots, and it honestly does a way better job at getting my hair to a medium brown. My roots are now a very dark chestnut brown color so I'm a bit sad that I didn't just go with my usual.\n\nSince I have two boxes and the bleach seems to be extremely mild, I may give it another go in a few days but I defintely won't buy this again.",

It took me 3 applications (3x product over course of 6 months) to get to a medium brown where I'm happy and other coloring will likely come through. The first application my mom didn't even say anything so it must have been a very slight change. The result looks more evident under natural light.\n\nThe instructions are easy and helpful. I tend to leave mine on for 45 minutes but I'm not willing to keep it longer because while it is gentle it'll still srip something from the hair strands.\n\nMy hair is thick as in the stands and the volume so that likely impacted how much the product worked. I'm happy with my third application result and look forward to using other foam coloring soon.",

It didn’t cover my gray hair at all. I was so disappointed. My hair look basically the same as before , which is black/medium dark brown. Maybe because I never bleach my hair before that’s why the color didn’t stay on? I’m not sure.",
