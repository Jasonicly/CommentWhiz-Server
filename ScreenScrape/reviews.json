      "body": "Renpho is a well-designed weighing scale which comes with its own App. The manufacturer had also included 2 Double-A batteries, so the scale could be used right out of the box.\nOnce you’ve downloaded the Renpho App, it’s easy to pair it with your smart phone.\nJust turn on your Bluetooth, click on the “paired device”, step on the scale and you’ll receive important information about your body muscle, visceral fat and BMI all on 1 easy-to-read page.\nI also liked the fact that the Renpho weighing scale could pair with multiple users, so my other family members could also use this scale and chart their weight trend. All they had to go was download the Renpho App onto their own phones and repeat the initial syncing steps like I did and they get their own readings.\nPro-Tip: scan the QR code to download the Renpho App. Otherwise, if you searched by name, you might download the wrong Renpho App as there were a few Apps with similar names.",

Its nice having the extra features but take it with pinch of salt and just as something fun to take a look at and play with.",

      "body": "I don't know how accurate this is, but it seems to work fine. Just step on it, let it calibrate, and then install the Renpho app on my mobile as I stand on it for 10-15 seconds. Tracking the measurements over the course of 2 weeks seemed to be pretty consistent so I'm happy with that. There's an athletic mode too for people like me who exercise 4-5 days a week, and it shows all kinds of data on the app, so that's kinda neat. Also, I got it on sale for 25 bucks so it's pretty cheap considering what it does. If you need a cheap scale that does its job reasonably well, then yeah I'd recommend this scale 100%. Although I'm not so sure this scale gives off 100% accurate body fat % and muscle mass numbers, the key thing is that it tracks your fat/loss gain over time consistently, so I can really see my fat% going down if I hit my macros/exercises right, and it going up along with 0.2-0.3 muscle mass loss when I skip my exercises for a few days.",
